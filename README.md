# reverse-critterpedia

A CLI tool to look up bug and fish data for Animal Crossing New Horizons

While full design is currently up in the air, this could end up in one of two ways:

* "one-shot" where the whole thing processes a single request
* interactive where the tool runs until ctrl-c is input

Why not both? Default behavior could be standard cli with interactive being triggered by a flag
